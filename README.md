#### Summary of some Katas or Applications done for Software Engineering Subjects in my University.

Software Engineering I & Software Engineering II trained us to define the architecture of Software (And its components, interfaces & dependencies). These Katas are focused to understand some design fundamentals like:

- Modularity
- Cohesion
- Coupling
- Abstraction

They show important design principles, design patterns and architecture styles, strategies and design tools to create applications too.

Katas are ordered by their difficulty as "Kata1" is the easiest and "Kata7" is the hardest to understand. Nevertheless, all Katas have been done in an academic environment so they are not complex at all. All katas have been programmed using *Java* as **programming language**. Enjoy them!

#### What's shown in each Kata?

##### Kata 1

Simple Person Project to calculate a **Person Age** by his birthdate.

##### Kata 2

Simple **Histogram** Project to count how many times is a person name repeated in a List.

##### Kata 3

Simple **Histogram** Project to **display** in a plot how many times is a mail repeated.

##### Kata 4

Simple **Histogram** Project with MVC (Model-View-Controller) Arquitecture to display in a plot how many times is a mail repeated. Mails are loaded from the **datafile** *email.txt*.

##### Kata 5

It's divided into two parts:

- **Kata 5A**

  SQL Database Connection Project that shows how Java can connect to a *SQLite DB* to execute some **SQL Orders**.

- **Kata 5B**

  **Histogram** Project with MVC (Model-View-Controller) Arquitecture that has the objective to display in a plot how many times is a mail repeated. Mails are loaded from the **database** *KATA5.db*.

##### Kata 6

Project that prints on screen how many files in your PC from a initial directory (User can change initial directory - ".." by default) have got a determinate size in MB using recursivity and a map. Project uses some created types of **Iterators** to accomplish that objective.

##### Kata 7

**Analogue Clock Project** that uses some Math Operations to display it. It uses an interesting MVP (Model-View-Presenter) Arquitecture.

##### Optional Kata

Optional Kata that was done in order to get taught about using **Test-Driven Development**. It's developed using JUnit as a unit testing framework for Java.
